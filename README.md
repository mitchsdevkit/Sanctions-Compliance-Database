# Sanctions-Compliance-Database

Hello! Thank you for reviewing my project.

This Repository will demostrate the steps and methodologies to create a searchable database for Specially Designated Nationals and individuals, entities, and vessels on the Consolidated Screening List available at trade.gov.

Please read the 'db procedure_Consolidated Screening List.pdf' file for complete instructions. 

Supplemental data validation files can be found at treasury.gov and these optional instructions are listed in the full procedural document.

Thanks for reading!
-Mitch
